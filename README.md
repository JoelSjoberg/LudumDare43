Theme : Sacrifices must be made

A game where you sacrifice your peers in order to reach the goal by using their remains.

Controlls are non-intuitive.

Use Q,W,E,R,T to summon a peer and launch it by holding space (or left mouse button) and then releasing it. you can sacrifice the peer in motion by pressing the space bar again (or right mouse button) and then summon another peer. You can reset each level by pressing ‘p’ and zoom in/out by pressing ‘m’.
